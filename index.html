    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>In an increasingly interconnected world, the pursuit of better opportunities often leads individuals to
      undertake perilous journeys across borders. The dreams of a brighter future, however, often meet the unforgiving
      realities
      of the migration experience. The Missing Migrants Project, an initiative spearheaded by the International
      Organization for Migration (IOM) since 2014, endeavors to shed light on the tragic stories of those who embark
      on
      these treacherous paths and, in doing so, disappear from our collective consciousness.

    <p>From 2014 onwards, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) has recorded 9428 incidents where
      migrants
      have either gone missing or experienced fatality. Of these incidents:

          In the wake of these tragic incidents, a total of <span class="standout">39,759</span> lives have been forever

          the limitations of data collection in this context. The figures presented likely represent an
          undercount, a sobering reminder of the complexities inherent in tracking those who vanish along migration
          routes. These numbers serve as a stark reminder of the human cost behind migration, urging us to reflect on
          the stories and lives behind the statistics.</p>

          <p>The tapestry of incidents leading to a total of <span class="standout">9,248</span> cases encompasses heartbreaking tales of drowning in
            treacherous waters, accidents that claimed 411 lives, and healthcare denied to 691 individuals when they
            needed it most. Hunger, thirst, and the harsh elements have relentlessly snatched away 1,154 lives, while
            violence has cast its dark shadow over 781 others. Yet, within this mosaic of tragedy, 2,519 cases remain
            shrouded in mystery, their causes hidden from the records. These numbers cease to be mere statistics;
            instead, they serve as powerful reminders of the human toll exacted by the arduous journey of migration.

        Across North America, Africa, Asia, and the vast oceans, migrant incidents paint a somber picture of the
        challenges
        faced by those seeking refuge, prosperity, or reunification with loved ones. North America, with 3,459 recorded
        incidents, stands as a coveted destination for migrants facing an arduous journey marked by border enforcement
        measures,
        treacherous terrains, and the menacing presence of human traffickers. In Africa, where 2,282 incidents have
        occurred,
        diverse migration routes traverse harsh deserts and unforgiving waters, exposing individuals to the risks of
        extreme
        conditions, violence, and a lack of essential resources. Asia, with 1,453 incidents, grapples with its own
        complex
        migration landscape, marked by overcrowded boats, remote routes, and disparities in wealth, while the ocean,
        accounting
        for 1,745 incidents, serves as a challenging pathway, where desperate migrants often confront accidents and
        drownings.
        These regions and the perilous journeys within them underscore the pressing need for comprehensive international
        cooperation and humanitarian efforts to ensure the safety and well-being of those in search of a better life.
